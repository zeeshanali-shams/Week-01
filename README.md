Week-01
This week work was based on interface.
Two packages were made: 'com.zeeshan.week01.iface' and 'com.zeeshan.week01.impl'.
The first one carried an interface named 'Function' which was having three methods(unary, binary and ternary).
The second package carried a three classes 'Sum', 'Product' and 'LowestCommonMultiple' carrying the methods from the interface 'Function'.
